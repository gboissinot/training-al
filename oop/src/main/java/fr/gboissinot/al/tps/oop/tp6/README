## Description
- DIP and DI illustration with the repository pattern

## Notes
- A Service object uses a registry object through an abstraction (DIP pattern)
- The repository interface has several implementations : InMemory, Stub, Oracle
- The chosen implementation is injected (DI) at the wiring step into the Main class
